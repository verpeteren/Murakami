Murakami
========

JSDOC-Toolkit template that trys to mimick haruki template of jsdoc3.

#Requirements

* [JSDOC-Toolkit](http://code.google.com/p/jsdoc-toolkit/) 
* [json2.js] (included)
* And some JSDOCs formatted code.

#Rationale

* JSdoc3 does not handle arbitrary files with jsdoc
* JSdoc2 handles the @name tag nice, but there is no json output

#What is with the name?
jsdoc3 json output plugin was named Haruki.
Apparently Haruki Murakami is a famous writer.

#Example
Probably as one of the few people around I like to use Makefiles. See the example direcory

#License
The Murakami template is, like JSDOC Toolkit itself, published under the X11/MIT License.
